# \<scary-mdx-data\>

A helper element to transfer a raw mdx query result (directly converted from XML to JSON) into a suitable format for the other scary-mdx elements.

Ideally you would do this pre-processing in your backend.

This element also explains how the data should be structured for the other scary-mdx elements.

(WIP, I might change around this structure quite a bit depending on what needs I discover for the other elements)
